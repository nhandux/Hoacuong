Free radicals are unstable molecules produced from sources like air pollution, radiation, and chemicals. They are also caused by bad diets high in fat and can even be caused by over exercising. These free radicals can over run your system and are now recognized to cause devastating health problems, such as heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. They are a major concern in premature aging.
Ways to prevent Free Radical damage are:
. Increase your intake of antioxidants like Vitamin A and E. Eat a diet high in colorful fruits and vegetables. Reduce your use of chemicals in and around the home. Source natural skin care products that contain anti oxidants
Using natural skin care products will significantly reduce the amount of chemical substances you absorb into your body that can cause premature aging. Some 'every day' chemicals such as synthetic emollients contained in some commercial products can be stored by the body in the liver and lymph nodes. Others such as Sodium Lauryl Sulphates can irritate the skin.

If you find that book, pay special attention to the chapter titled, itten by demons.? The woman had fang marks in her arm from being bitten by a demon. Sumrall cast the demons out of her.

Worley compiled a list of some 1,100 names of demons. I not sure that necessary. I believe the Holy Ghost (or, Holy Spirit) guides Christians who cast out demons. Don ever try to cast out demons if youe not a Christian. You could get hurt like the seven sons of Sceva in the book of Acts. They were Jewish, but not Christians, and got beaten up by the demon-possessed man.
Another name for Jews who are Christians is essianic Jews,?or, you might say, ulfilled Jews.? Jews who are not Messianic Jews are still looking for the Messiah (the savior) to come, and are unaware that he has already come, and that his name is Jesus.
